# hello-world
My first repository.
====================

Hello,

My name is Jonathan Morris, and I am hereby starting back on the road to programming as a hobby, and to get a job that is relative to my degree (programming). This is my first time using GitHub on my own, so wish me luck.

Regards,
Jonathan
